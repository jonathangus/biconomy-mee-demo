# Implementation Approach & Lessons Learned

This document covers how I built the MEE Super-Transaction Demo, the issues I ran into, and what I learned along the way.

## üî® How I Approached This

### My Working Method

1. **Research Phase**: Started by reading the MEE docs and Zero-to-Hero guides to understand the basics
2. **Context Building**: Ran `repomix` on the key repos to generate a good knowledge base:
   - https://github.com/bcnmy/abstractjs (main SDK)
   - https://github.com/bcnmy/examples (implementation examples)  
   - https://github.com/bcnmy/abstract-docs (documentation source)
3. **Planning**: Used this knowledge to create an implementation guide with architecture, code style, and logic
4. **Iterative Development**: Built incrementally, applying learnings at each step

### Tech Stack Choices

**Core**: Bun, TypeScript, Viem, Zod, Pino
**Infrastructure**: Docker, Anvil, Foundry
**Testing**: Vitest with comprehensive mocks

The goal was to create a testable SDK that you initialize once and pass around everywhere, with full TypeScript integration and proper error handling.

## üêõ Issues I Ran Into

### Network Configuration Headaches
**Problem**: Initially used `localhost` for Anvil, but Docker containers couldn't reach it.
**Solution**: Had to change Anvil host to `0.0.0.0` and use `host.docker.internal` in MEE node config for proper Docker networking.

### Confusing Error Messages  
**Problem**: Kept seeing scary logs like "Execution error: execution reverted: custom error 0x220266b6: @AA20 account not deployed" and thought something was broken.
**Reality**: These are actually normal during account abstraction setup - the error just means the smart account hasn't been deployed yet, which is expected.

### Transaction Timing Issues
**Problem**: Waiting for transactions could take forever, making debugging painful.
**Solution**: Used `getSupertransactionReceipt` instead of `waitForSupertransactionReceipt` to get better debugging control and added proper timeout handling.

### toEcosystem Integration
**Problem**: Wanted to use `toEcosystem` for better Anvil integration but ran out of time to get it working properly.
**Reality**: Had to stick with standard account creation approach, missing some potential optimizations.

### LLM Documentation Integration
**Problem**: Using LLMs to parse and understand the Abstract documentation wasn't very effective.
**Solution Needed**: Would be valuable to provide an LLM.txt file or a cursor rule on the documentation website to make it easier for AI tools to consume and understand the documentation structure, examples, and API references.

## üßó Key Challenges

### Spending 100% of USDC Balance
This was trickier than expected. Had to figure out how to use `runtimeERC20BalanceOf` to spend exactly all available USDC without leaving dust or running out of gas money.

**Solution**: Used `runtimeERC20BalanceOf` in the instruction builders to dynamically query balance at execution time. The key was understanding that this queries the balance right when the transaction executes, not when you build the instruction.

**Additional Discovery**: To use the trigger properly, we needed to set `includeFee: true` in the trigger configuration. This automatically accounts for gas fees when calculating the maximum spendable amount. Combined with `runtimeERC20BalanceOf` in instructions, this allows spending the exact available balance.

**Documentation Issue**: The docs at https://docs.biconomy.io/sdk-reference/mee-client/methods/getFusionQuote/#trigger-object incorrectly show `useMaxAvailableAmount: boolean` as a property, but this doesn't actually exist in the API. The real solution is using `includeFee: true`.

### Service Orchestration  
Getting Docker containers, Anvil, and MEE node to play nicely together required:
- Proper health checks with retries
- Sequential startup with dependency management  
- Graceful cleanup when things go wrong


## üîç Debugging Tricks

- **Transaction Monitoring**: Used detailed status checking instead of just waiting
- **Service Health**: Added spinners and clear progress indicators  
- **Balance Verification**: Before/after comparisons with formatted output
- **Structured Logging**: Different levels with prominent transaction info

## üöÄ Future Ideas

### Multi-Chain SDK
The current SDK is single-chain focused. Would be cool to add:
- Native cross-chain coordination
- Unified balance tracking
- Chain-agnostic instruction builders

### Better Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry for recoverable errors
- Better transaction failure analysis

### Developer Experience  
- Hot reloading for faster dev cycles
- Better debugging tools
- Automated environment validation
